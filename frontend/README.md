# React Frontend

## Installation

Once the frontend container is up and running, run `yarn install` to install dependencies on it using yarn.
Use `yarn dev` to turn on the React development server in your localhost port 9000.

## Notes

- We use the React Router framework for frontend development (ignore backend/fullstack features)
- We communicate to the backend via a HTTP REST API
